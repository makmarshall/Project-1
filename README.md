## For a selected population, discover at least two (2) things about this group.

For Hispanic or Latino Women or those who prefer not to say their gender: Every one of them except one put Affordable Cost as having a high impact on why they chose CCM, the one who didn't put High Impact, put Some Impact. As for Financial Aid's impact, again only one said that it was of No Impact.

Also none of them had gone to any of these events: Women Who Dare, CyberSecurity Information Protection Program Participation, Corporate Training, Teen Arts Festival, or the Summer Camp at CCM.

## Two Questions from my Previously Submitted:

### Which way of receiving information was the least noted? (Where should we focus on upping our advertisements?)

The least reported ways of receiving information about CCM was via: (In order of least reported to most)
1. The radio (One report)
2. In-App Advertisement (Three reports)
3. Employer, or Television (Both with Five reports)

### Which were the most attended events specifically by women of color?

The most attended events for women of color were:
1. HS Sharetime Information Session (10 attended)
2. Open House, On-Campus Information Session, and Information Session at my high school (each had 9 WOC attendees)
3. Titans Tuesday (Virtual) Information Session, and Campus Visit (individual) (each had 8 WOC attendees)

## Two Insights:

1. The most reported ways of people hearing about CCM was via a family member or friend, or from a highschool teacher or counselor. The most common way to spread information about CCM may be simply through word of mouth.
2. Lots of people specifically chose CCM for it's affordability, speaking on that would be helpful.
